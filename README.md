# ESP32 Motor Controller

A comprehensive Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled motor controller for ESP32, designed to control stepper motors through a DM542T driver. The system supports both wireless control via iOS app and direct serial commands, with advanced features including historic data playback, acceleration testing, and automatic homing.

## Features

### Core Motor Control
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** connectivity for wireless control
- **Serial Command Interface** for direct control via Arduino IDE
- **DM542T Stepper Driver** compatibility with configurable microsteps
- **Ball Screw Control** with precise positioning in millimeters
- **Automatic Homing** with limit switch on GPIO23

### Advanced Functionality
- **Historic Data Playback** from CSV files (up to 2400 data points)
- **Acceleration Test Loops** for motion profile visualization
- **Real-time Monitoring** of position, velocity, and acceleration
- **CSV Data Upload** via Bluetooth for custom motion profiles
- **SPIFFS Storage** for persistent historic data

### Configuration & Monitoring
- **Configurable Parameters** including acceleration, velocity, and travel limits
- **Pin Inversion Settings** for compatibility with different driver wiring
- **Flash Memory Storage** for persistent configuration
- **Real-time Status Monitoring** via BLE notifications and serial output
- **Arduino Serial Plotter** support for data visualization

## Hardware Requirements

### Essential Components
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **DM542T Stepper Motor Driver**
- **Stepper Motor** (compatible with DM542T)
- **Ball Screw Assembly** (5mm pitch recommended)
- **Power Supply** (24V recommended for DM542T)

### Optional Components
- **Limit Switch** for homing (connects to GPIO23)
- **iOS Device** for wireless control
- **Pull-down resistor** (internal pulldown used for homing switch)

### Recommended Specifications
- Ball screw pitch: 5mm per revolution
- Microstep setting: 1600 steps/revolution (8 microsteps)
- Homing switch: Normally open, connects GPIO23 to VCC when closed

## Pin Configuration

| Function | ESP32 Pin | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Pulse | GPIO26 | Step pulse signal to DM542T |
| Direction | GPIO27 | Direction control signal |
| Enable | GPIO25 | Motor enable/disable signal |
| Homing Switch | GPIO23 | Limit switch input (with internal pulldown) |
| LED | GPIO2 | Status LED (built-in) |

### Homing Switch Wiring
- GPIO23 configured with internal pulldown resistor
- Switch should be normally open
- When closed, switch connects GPIO23 to VCC (3.3V)
- Switch activation automatically sets position to 0.0mm

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd ESP32_Motor_Controller
   ```

2. **Arduino IDE Setup**
   - Install ESP32 board package in Arduino IDE
   - Install required libraries:
     - AccelStepper
     - ESP32 BLE Arduino
     - SPIFFS (included with ESP32 package)

3. **Choose Version**
   - **ESP32_Motor_Controller.ino**: Basic version with original features
   - **ESP32_Motor_Controller_Enhanced.ino**: Full-featured version with all new capabilities

4. **Upload to ESP32**
   - Connect ESP32 via USB
   - Select appropriate board and port
   - Upload the chosen sketch
   - Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud for status and control

## Configuration

The motor controller can be configured via BLE commands (iOS app) or serial commands (Arduino IDE). All settings are automatically saved to flash memory.

### Operation Modes

#### Playback Mode
- Follows historic CSV data for position vs. time
- Supports up to 2400 data points (120 seconds at 20Hz)
- Linear interpolation for smooth motion
- Only displacement stored, time reconstructed from 20Hz sampling
- Need to upload from App first

#### Acceleration Test Mode
- Configurable distance and acceleration parameters
- Continuous back-and-forth motion with constant acceleration/deceleration
- Ideal for testing and visualization of acceleration profiles

#### Homing
- Automatic position referencing using limit switch
- Moves forward 5mm, then backward until switch triggers
